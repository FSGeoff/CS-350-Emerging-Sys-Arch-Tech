# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

### *Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.* ###

I was required to master writing interface software, analyzing hardware architecture, and recommending emerging technologies. The CEO wants us to create a smart thermostat using the TI board and connect it to SysTecâ€™s server software over Wi-Fi. For the prototype, I will use the TMP006 temperature sensor, an LED, two buttons, and UART. I will also compare and contrast hardware architectures from TI, Microchip, and Freescale based on specific business requirements.
